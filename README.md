# 🐦 Bird Balance Demonstrator (Centroid-Based Structure)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bird Balance Demonstrator** is a physical model designed to visually and practically demonstrate the concept of **centroid** and **structural balance** in engineering. Shaped like a bird, the model maintains equilibrium on a single point, showcasing principles from applied mechanics in an engaging and hands-on way.

This project was developed as part of an academic fabrication assignment to reinforce theoretical concepts with real-world application.
